# prosodypro-R
This repo has the code I'm developing to import [ProsodyPro] (http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~uclyyix/ProsodyPro/) output files into [R] (https://www.r-project.org) and work with the data. ProsodyPro is a Praat script developed by [Yi Xu] (http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~uclyyix/) at [Haskins Lab] (http://www.haskins.yale.edu) to assist linguists in performing "large-scale systematic prosody analysis" on digital sound data (.wav files). It facilitates the process of annotating sound files using Praat TextGrid (xml) files and automatically extracts acoustic measurements (f0, duration, f0 velocity, etc.) and writes them to text files. These output files can then be imported into R and plotted and used for statistical analysis.
