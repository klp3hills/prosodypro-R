## Introduction

Use this document to help you to create ensemble files with ***\_ProsodyPro6.1.4\_beta\_extract.praat*** after you have finished the annotation of all tokens in the large ```.wav``` file containing all experiment tokens.[^1] Yi Xu created this version of the script for me which creates individual sound files for each token in the large file. This is necessary in order to allow for compensation in cases where an item was recorded out of order (e.g. B1 recorded before finishing all A items: A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, ***B1***, A8, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8,â€¦) and to allow "across speaker" averaging because it allows the items to be processed in the order of their file names. Xu also recommends using the latest non-beta version to do the processing since this version has more features and can do the average across speakers properly. The major difference in usage of that script is that you need to run it in the folder *above* the individual speaker folders. If the speaker folders are inside the folder where the ProsodyPro script is, the speaker folder file should contain just the folder names, on per line.


[^1]: Processing data in one large file (rather than separate sound files for each token in the experiment) became possible in ProsodyPro 6 beta.

## Instructions

1. Run the script with **Task 3: Process all sentences** selected and **Keep sentences in recording** checked
  + This creates individual sound files for each item
  + Watch for error messages saying that there were no annotations for a file
  + If you have to redo this step, delete all the sound files that were created because the script will try to process them too (or you can, probably, just ignore the error message)
2. Run the script again with **Task 4: Get ensemble files** and **Keep sentences in recording** unchecked and **Nrepetitions = 8**
  + This will calculate the averages for each item based on the file names disregarding the integer at the end of each file name
3. Calculating across speaker average...
